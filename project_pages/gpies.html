            <p class="content-text">
                This project was the main product of the first 6 months of my senior capstone project at Oregon State University.
                Below I describe the evolution of the project and the things we learned.

            <h3>Problem</h3>

            <p class="content-text">
                When a material is exposed to radiation, it is bombarded with high-energy particles that are capable
                of knocking atoms out of place. This creates defects in the material which can move around, diffuse,
                and interact with each other.
            </p>
            
            <p class="content-text">
                The project was proposed and directed by a researcher of nuclear materials at Oregon
                State University, who kindly advised us throughout the process.
                The goal of the project was to prototype a GPU-accelerated simulation of the evolution of these defects
                in a material exposed to radiation, utilizing parallel computing to break the problem up into many
                pieces that could be computed at once. Improved simulation would help develop better models of material
                degradation by radiation, and an improved ability to predict how these defects affect
                material properties is important for the development of next-generation nuclear reactors.

            <h3>The Prototype</h3>

            <p class="content-text">
                We started by making a prototype based on a model of defect evolution described in a paper our project partner
                provided us
                (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022311503005129">
                https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022311503005129
                </a>). The model describes the rate of generation of defects as a function of some features of the environment such as
                temperature, radiation flux, and the existing defect structure. We used the

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a>
                
                to solve for the concentration of different defects over time using these rates.
            </p>

            <p class="content-text">
                This approach was successful at simulating very small spans of time. However, the equations in the model we were
                simulating are considered "stiff" equations. Stiff equations are very difficult to simulate over
                longer than a few microseconds using the Euler method, no matter how much parallel computation you throw at it. The
                reason for this is essentially that some of the defects in the material change very fast, and so trying to directly
                extrapolate their state into the future based on just their current rate of change, which is what the Euler method does, 
                only works if you simulate it in very impractically small increments of time. We would utilize some more advanced methods
                later on through a tool called <a>CVODES</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="content-text">
                There was another problem too - since this is still an unsolved problem, verifying the results of the simulation was
                a difficult, creative, and error-prone process. In the end we would just eyeball a graph of
                empirically measured results and say it looks close enough, and the results of simulations done by previous researchers
                would vary enough that we couldn't think of a way to do a better comparison than eyeballing the shape of the graph.
            </p>

            <p class="content-text">
                This also meant we didn't know exactly what a good model of radiation damage would look like. The model we mimicked had some
                shortcomings that revealed themselves as we examined the simulation results with our adviser.
            </p>

            <h3>Premature Optimization and Examining Requirements</h3>

            <p class="content-text">
                Our process for working on the G-PIES prototype for the first 6 months was basically, our adviser would provide us with a mathematical
                model, he'd spend time with us to help us understand the reasoning behind the model, we'd talk with him about how we might
                simulate that model, we'd write the simulation, we'd spend a week or two trying to make sense of the results, 
                and based on some shortcoming we found in the results, and we'd bring our findings back to our adviser in our weekly meeting,
                where he would come up with an updated model for us to try. All the while, half of our team spent their days working on a 
                user interface for G-PIES as it evolved.
            </p>

            <p class="content-text">
                I think the problem with this workflow was that in practice, we ended up spending most of our time debugging the equations
                rather than the code. This was inevitable to some degree with an unsolved problem, but this process of debugging the equations 
                was what our material scientist adviser wanted to do himself for his research. I realized very late on in the project that
                the most important thing we could do to help his research was not to write a simulation for him, but to enable him to write
                simulations himself by somehow giving him access to the computational tools available through C++ without exposing him to some
                of the debugging nightmares that might result. He was not a technical lightweight by any stretch, but he didn't have the programming
                experience to quickly create and iterate on these complicated simulations which made use of some relatively advanced programming
                techniques like GPU parallelization.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                All of the mathematiclal models we'd talked about had a very similar structure, to the point that I felt their implementation
                as an executable simulation could be totally abstracted over. I ended up creating a program separate from G-PIES where you 
                can describe the math equations using a custom syntax (With the benefit of hindsight I should've just made a Python library or something), 
                and it generates human-readable C++ code which compiles into a runnable simulation on-par with G-PIES. Since I graduated shortly 
                after he first tried it, I don't know if it'll ever see good use, but even if it's not expressive enough to 
                create all of the models they will want to make in the future, the C++ it generates will give
                them a much better starting point for making new simulations than any specific simulation we could've written in advance.
