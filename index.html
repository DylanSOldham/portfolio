        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class="content-text">
            I'm a Senior student at Oregon State University studying Computer Science, with a strong
            interest in simulations and games.
        </p> 

        <p class="content-text">
            My goal is to work on cool stuff - to create things that I'll be glad I created. I tend 
            to most enjoy projects that either create significant experiences for the
            user (as compelling games do), or solve a specific and measurable problem.
        </p> 

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <p class="content-text">
            <strong>May 2020 - June 2022</strong> 
            <br>
            I participated in an internship with Group6 Studios on their 
            early-stage online multiplayer game <a href="https://www.battlecasters.io/">BattleCasters</a>, 
            where I primarily worked on gameplay programming and low-level graphics using OpenGL.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            <strong>Summer 2022</strong> 
            <br>
            I interned for ReplayLogic, a spin-out of Galois Inc, where I got practice
            with bread-and-butter topics like automated testing, creating CI workflows, programming frontend web 
            interfaces, writing REST endpoints, and using both relational and graph databases.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p class="content-text">
            <strong>Notable Skills</strong>
            <ul class="content-text">
                <li>Heavy user of Linux</li>
                <li>Graphical Tools: Blender, SDL2, LWJGL, OpenGL, GLSL, Unity</li>
                <li>GPU Acceleration: CUDA / Thrust </li>
                <li>Other: Github Workflows, GoogleTest</li>
            </ul>
            
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            For programming languages, I usually use C++ or JavaScript,
            but I'd be comfortable doing a technical interview using any of these languages:
            <ul class="content-text">
                <li>C</li>
                <li>C++98 / C++11 / C++14</li>
                <li>Haskell</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>JavaScript / TypeScript</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            There are some other languages, like Python or Rust, that I've used before on small projects, but where 
            I'd need to heavily rely on Google for help with basic syntax and functionality, so I have not 
            listed them above.
